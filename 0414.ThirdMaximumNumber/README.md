# [**414. 第三大的数 Third Maximum Number**](https://leetcode.com/problems/third-maximum-number)

## 题目原文

### Problem

Given integer array `nums`, return the third maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.

### Example 1

```shell
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
```

### Example 2

```shell
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

### Example 3

```shell
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```

**Constrains**:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`

- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
