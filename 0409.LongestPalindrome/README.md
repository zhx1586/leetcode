# [**409. 最长回文串 Longest Palindrome**](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindrome)

## 题目原文

### Problem

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case sensitive, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

### Example 1

```shell
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

### Example 2

```shell
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
```

### Example 3

```shell
Input: s = "bb"
Output: 2
```

**Constrains**:

- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`

- `s` consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters only.
